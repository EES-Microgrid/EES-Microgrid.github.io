<h2 style="font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif; font-size: 1.5em; font-weight: bold; color: #333; margin-top: -20px;">Microgrid Overview:</h2>

<p style="font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif; font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.6;">
    A microgrid is a group of interconnected loads and distributed energy resources within clearly defined electrical boundaries that acts as a single controllable entity with respect to the grid. It normally operates connected to and synchronous with the electrical power grid but can also operate autonomously, including entirely off-grid applications.
</p>

<p>
    Generally, the key components depicted in the figure include:
</p>
<ul style="font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif; font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.6;">
    <li>Electricity generation resources-Renewable or Conventional (e.g. solar PV arrays, wind energy conversion systems, diesel or natural gas generators.)</li>
    <li>Energy Storage systems (e.g. batteries, flywheels, pumped storage)</li>
    <li>Control systems: Typically, microgrids are managed through a central controller that coordinates distributed energy resources, balances electrical loads, and is responsible for disconnection and reconnection of the microgrid to the main grid.</li>
    <li>Loads (e.g. homes, businesses, institutions that consume electricity).</li>
</ul>

<h2 style="font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif; font-size: 1.5em; font-weight: bold; color: #333;">Resilience Benefits of Microgrids:</h2>

<p style="font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif; font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.6;">
    The primary resilience benefit of microgrids is their ability to disconnect from the main grid when there is an outage and operate autonomously. Thus, facilities connected to and powered by the microgrid can continue serving a community during an outage. This ability to continue serving critical loads, such as medical facilities or grocery stores, can mitigate the social and economic costs of disruptive events.
</p>

<p>
    Depending on their components, microgrids may also be able to provide additional benefits above and beyond energy resilience benefits:
</p>
<ul style="font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif; font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.6;">
    <li>Microgrids that incorporate renewable energy resources can have environmental benefits in terms of reduced greenhouse gas emissions and air pollutants.</li>
    <li>In some cases, microgrids can sell power back to the grid during normal operations.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    However, microgrids are just one way to improve the energy resilience of an electric grid, and they do have some potential disadvantages:
</p>
<ul style="font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif; font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.6;">
    <li>Depending on the complexity, microgrids can have high upfront capital costs.</li>
    <li>Microgrids are complex systems that require specialized skills to operate and maintain.</li>
    <li>Microgrids include controls and communication systems that contain cybersecurity risks.</li>
</ul>

<p style="font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif; font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.6;">
    Since microgrids are not the only way to enhance energy resilience, communities may want to consider alternate resilience investment options, including hardening existing transmission and distribution systems, weatherizing power generation sources, and building additional distribution systems to provide energy supply redundancy.

<p style="font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif; font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.6;">
  Developing robust microgrid control systems at both device level and energy management for grid-tied and off-grid modes highlighting weather and demand uncertainties.
