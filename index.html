<h2 style="font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif; font-size: 1.5em; font-weight: bold; color: #333; margin-top: -20px;">Microgrid Overview:</h2>

<p style="font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif; font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.6;">
    A microgrid is a collection of distributed energy resources and associated loads that function as a single, controllable unit in relation to the grid within precisely defined electrical limits. It can run independently, including in fully off-grid situations, but it often functions in synchrony with the electrical power grid.
</p>

<p>
    Generally, the key components depicted in the figure include:
</p>
<ul style="font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif; font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.6;">
    <li>Electricity generation resources-Renewable or Conventional (e.g. solar PV arrays, wind energy conversion systems, diesel generators.)</li>
    <li>Energy Storage systems (e.g. batteries, flywheels, pumped storage)</li>
    <li>Control systems: The management of distributed energy resources, balancing of electrical demands, and disconnecting and reconnecting the microgrid from the main grid are typically handled by a central controller found in most microgrid systems.</li>
    <li>Loads (e.g. homes, businesses, institutions that consume electricity).</li>
</ul>

<h2 style="font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif; font-size: 1.5em; font-weight: bold; color: #333;">Resilience Benefits of Microgrids:</h2>

<p style="font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif; font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.6;">
    Microgrids' capacity to function independently and separate from the main grid during an outage is its greatest resilience advantage. As a result, during an outage, facilities powered by and connected to the microgrid can continue to provide services to the community. Disruptive occurrences can have a less negative societal and economic impact if essential loads, like food stores and medical institutions, can still be served.
</p>

<p>
    Depending on their components, microgrids may also be able to provide additional benefits above and beyond energy resilience benefits:
</p>
<ul style="font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif; font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.6;">
    <li>Microgrids that incorporate renewable energy resources can have environmental benefits in terms of reduced greenhouse gas emissions and air pollutants.</li>
    <li>In some cases, microgrids can sell power back to the grid during normal operations.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    However, microgrids are just one way to improve the energy resilience of an electric grid, and they do have some potential disadvantages:
</p>
<ul style="font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif; font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.6;">
    <li>Depending on the complexity, microgrids can have high upfront capital costs.</li>
    <li>Microgrids are complex systems that require specialized skills to operate and maintain.</li>
    <li>Microgrids include controls and communication systems that contain cybersecurity risks.</li>
</ul>

<p style="font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif; font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.6;">
    Since microgrids are not the only way to enhance energy resilience, communities may want to consider alternate resilience investment options, including hardening existing transmission and distribution systems, weatherizing power generation sources, and building additional distribution systems to provide energy supply redundancy.

<p style="font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif; font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.6;">
  Developing robust microgrid control systems at both device level and energy management for grid-tied and off-grid modes highlighting weather and demand uncertainties.
