There are two types of energy sources: nonrenewable, which uses limited resources, and renewable, which is easily renewed. Discover the benefits of using renewable energy sources and how to make better use of nonrenewable ones.

**a) Microgrids in General:**
 A collection of localized sources and loads, known as a microgrid, can function independently as a stand-alone system in addition to being connected to and operating in synchrony with the traditional centralized electrical grid. They can effectively integrate renewable energy sources and remain robust during blackouts because to their autonomy.

**b) Solar Photovoltaics:**
PV materials and devices convert sunlight into electrical energy. A single PV device is known as a cell. An individual PV cell is usually small, typically producing about 1 or 2 watts of power.
In order to withstand the outdoors for many years, cells are sandwiched between protective materials in a combination of glass and/or plastics.
To boost the power output of PV cells, they are connected together in chains to form larger units known as modules or panels. Modules can be used individually, or several can be connected to form arrays. One or more arrays is then connected to the electrical grid as part of a complete PV system. Because of this modular structure, PV systems can be built to meet almost any electric power need, small or large.
PV modules and arrays are just one part of a PV system. Systems also include mounting structures that point panels toward the sun, along with the components that take the direct-current (DC) electricity produced by modules and convert it to the alternating-current (AC) electricity used to power all of the appliances in your home.
